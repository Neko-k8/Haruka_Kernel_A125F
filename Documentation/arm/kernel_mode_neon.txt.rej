 Therefore, the recommended and only supported way of using NEON/VFP in the
 kernel is by adhering to the following rules:
 * isolate the NEON code in a separate compilation unit and compile it with
-  '-mfpu=neon -mfloat-abi=softfp';
+  '-march=armv7-a -mfpu=neon -mfloat-abi=softfp';
 * issue the calls to kernel_neon_begin(), kernel_neon_end() as well as the calls
   into the unit containing the NEON code from a compilation unit which is *not*
   built with the GCC flag '-mfpu=neon' set.
