-The goal of the Linux kernel security team is to work with the bug
-submitter to understand and fix the bug.  We prefer to publish the fix as
-soon as possible, but try to avoid public discussion of the bug itself
-and leave that to others.
-
-Publishing the fix may be delayed when the bug or the fix is not yet
-fully understood, the solution is not well-tested or for vendor
-coordination.  However, we expect these delays to be short, measurable in
-days, not weeks or months.  A release date is negotiated by the security
-team working with the bug submitter as well as vendors.  However, the
-kernel security team holds the final say when setting a timeframe.  The
-timeframe varies from immediate (esp. if it's already publicly known bug)
-to a few weeks.  As a basic default policy, we expect report date to
-release date to be on the order of 7 days.
+Disclosure and embargoed information

+The security list is not a disclosure channel.  For that, see Coordination

+Once a robust fix has been developed, the release process starts.  Fixes
+for publicly known bugs are released immediately.
+
+Although our preference is to release fixes for publicly undisclosed bugs
+as soon as they become available, this may be postponed at the request of
+the reporter or an affected party for up to 7 calendar days from the start
+of the release process, with an exceptional extension to 14 calendar days
+if it is agreed that the criticality of the bug requires more time.  The
+only valid reason for deferring the publication of a fix is to accommodate
+the logistics of QA and large scale rollouts which require release
+coordination.
+
+Whilst embargoed information may be shared with trusted individuals in
+order to develop a fix, such information will not be published alongside
+the fix or on any other disclosure channel without the permission of the
+reporter.  This includes but is not limited to the original bug report
+and followup discussions (if any), exploits, CVE information or the
+identity of the reporter.
+
+In other words our only interest is in getting bugs fixed.  All other
+information submitted to the security list and any followup discussions
+of the report are treated confidentially even after the embargo has been
+lifted, in perpetuity.
